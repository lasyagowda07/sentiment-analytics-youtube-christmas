@derekwhittle2158,It really resonates with me this one. As a dad that’s age with a son a little bit older we’ve not seen eye to eye in ten years. ( nothing bad just teenage coming age stuff and me also getting into my fifties). As he’s got older the last few weeks I see him as 24 year old man rather than the toddler he was or the petulant teenager messing up his exams.
