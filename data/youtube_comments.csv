Bought him an album By the four seasons in xmass1975  and this advert is so like that day 50yrs ago . Lost dad when he was just 42 in 1985 of cancer . I'm the dad of 4 daughters and 4 grandsons now, still miss dad but this advert really does make me feel like he is close to me still. At 61 now life has gone full circle here's to the next 61yrs and thank John Lewis well done you really scored a goal with this years advert .

@derekwhittle2158,It really resonates with me this one. As a dad that’s age with a son a little bit older we’ve not seen eye to eye in ten years. ( nothing bad just teenage coming age stuff and me also getting into my fifties). As he’s got older the last few weeks I see him as 24 year old man rather than the toddler he was or the petulant teenager messing up his exams.  The record is poignant as he’s been helping me do his sisters house up next door to a dj from the most famous rave club in the world  x,2025-11-07T07:42:02Z,5
